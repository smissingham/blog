# The Github Repo Behind My Blog

This is the git repository that I use to house my digital garden.

The blog itself is hosted at https://missingham.net

You can reach me via email <a href="mailto:sean@missingham.net">sean@missingham.net</a>

I use a few tools for this, primarily these below. 
Go show them some love!

- [Quartz by Jacky Zhao](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/)
- [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/)

Thanks for stopping by!
