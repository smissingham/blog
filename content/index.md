G'day, welcome to my *[Digital Garden](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/philosophy)*, where I keep my notes on thoughts, experiments, and how-to's.

I love to build & experiment with new technologies, applying my passion for software wherever I can.

My professional experience revolves primarily around revenue management,  so you'll find this blog to be a mix of revenue related software engineering & data analysis topics. 

This space is brand new as of May '24. Please take a look in the following spaces for my work so far
- [[Apps--and--Tooling]]
- [[Works-in-Progress]]
