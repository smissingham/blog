After over a decade as a professional software developer, I still use Windows as my primary operating system. Despite trying many Linux distros, and even an Apple ðŸ«¢ Macbook, I still return to Windows as my daily driver.

Quick caveat, I love Linux (specifically Ubuntu), but not for a daily work station. 

I'll keep the *why* short, there's enough posts out there debating such. For me, it's:
- First class support (productive time)
- Microsoft Office
- Video Games

> This is not another debate on why, but  a list of the things that I use to make Windows great


## PowerToys
#### FancyZones


# Chocolatey - Package Manager

# WSL2 - Linux Kernel

# Docker - Containerization
