It's very common in software to need large swathes of synthetic data that *seems* legitimate.
Common uses include stress testing pre-production environments, capability demos and more.

I've done a lot of this recently, and will soon be spending a weekend re-doing it in my own time.
I want to use Rust, Polars and SIMD, and I want to open-source the outputs onto Huggingface so others who have my same requirements need not reinvent the wheel.
